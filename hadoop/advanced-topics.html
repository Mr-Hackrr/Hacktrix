      <h2>Understanding Kafka: A Distributed Streaming Platform for Real-Time Data Streaming</h2>
      <p>Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed streaming platform designed to handle large volumes of real-time data. Originally developed by LinkedIn and now part of the Apache Software Foundation, Kafka is renowned for its ability to manage high-throughput data feeds with low latency and high fault tolerance. It serves as a central hub for data streams, enabling real-time data processing and analytics.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Role of Kafka in Handling High-Throughput Data Feeds</h2>
      <p>Kafka excels in scenarios where large amounts of data need to be ingested, processed, and analyzed in real-time. Its architecture is built to handle high-throughput data feeds efficiently, ensuring that data flows smoothly between producers and consumers. Kafka’s distributed nature allows it to scale horizontally, adding more nodes to handle increased data loads without compromising performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Real-Time Data Streaming with Kafka</h2>
      <p>Kafka supports real-time streaming applications through its robust and scalable architecture. Here’s how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Producers and Consumers:</strong> Kafka operates on a publish-subscribe model where producers publish data to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to consume the data. This decouples data producers from consumers, allowing for flexible and scalable data processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Topics and Partitions:</strong> Data in Kafka is organized into topics, which are further divided into partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that allows for parallel processing. This partitioning mechanism ensures that Kafka can handle high-throughput data streams efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Brokers and Clusters:</strong> Kafka runs as a cluster of one or more servers (brokers) that manage the storage and retrieval of data. The cluster ensures data durability and availability by replicating data across multiple brokers.</li>
        <li><strong>Stream Processing:</strong> Kafka provides a Streams API that allows applications to process data in real-time as it flows through the system. This enables complex event processing, transformations, and aggregations on the fly.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Understanding Hadoop Security: Authentication, Authorization, and Data Encryption</h2>
      <p>Hadoop security is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring that only authorized users can access and manipulate the data stored within the Hadoop ecosystem. Hadoop provides robust mechanisms for authentication, authorization, and data encryption to safeguard data integrity and privacy.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Authentication in Hadoop</h2>
      <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Hadoop commonly uses Kerberos for authentication, which is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client-server applications.</p>
      <h3>Kerberos Authentication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT):</strong> When a user logs in, they request a TGT from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). The KDC verifies the user’s credentials and issues a TGT.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Ticket:</strong> The user then uses the TGT to request access to specific Hadoop services. The KDC issues a service ticket, which the user presents to the Hadoop service to gain access.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Authentication:</strong> Kerberos ensures mutual authentication, meaning both the user and the service verify each other’s identity, enhancing security.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  
    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Authorization in Hadoop</h2>
      <p>Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Hadoop provides several mechanisms for access control:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HDFS Permissions:</strong> Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) uses a POSIX-like permission model, where files and directories have read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> ACLs provide more fine-grained access control than traditional POSIX permissions, allowing specific permissions to be granted to individual users or groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Ranger and Sentry:</strong> Apache Ranger and Apache Sentry are frameworks that provide centralized security administration, fine-grained authorization, and auditing capabilities for Hadoop. They allow administrators to define and enforce security policies across the Hadoop ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  
    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Data Encryption in Hadoop</h2>
      <p>Data encryption ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access both in transit and at rest.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> Data is encrypted while being transmitted over the network to prevent eavesdropping and tampering. Hadoop supports encryption in transit using protocols such as SSL/TLS.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Data is encrypted while stored on disk to protect it from unauthorized access. Hadoop supports encryption at rest through the Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS), which manages encryption keys and policies.</li>
      </ul>
