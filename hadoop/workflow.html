      <h2>Introducing Oozie: A Workflow Scheduling Tool for Managing Hadoop Jobs</h2>
      <p>Apache Oozie is a robust, server-based workflow scheduling system designed to manage and coordinate Hadoop jobs. It allows users to define a sequence of actions in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) format, ensuring that complex workflows are executed in a reliable and orderly manner. Oozie integrates seamlessly with the Hadoop ecosystem, supporting various types of Hadoop jobs such as MapReduce, Pig, Hive, Sqoop, and more.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Workflow Scheduling with Oozie</h2>
      <p>Oozie excels at scheduling and coordinating complex workflows by providing a flexible and powerful framework. Here’s how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Workflow Definition:</strong> Workflows in Oozie are defined using XML, where each workflow is a collection of control flow and action nodes. Control flow nodes dictate the execution path (e.g., start, end, decision, fork, join), while action nodes specify the actual tasks to be performed (e.g., running a MapReduce job, executing a Pig script).</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Oozie Coordinator jobs manage the execution of workflows based on time (frequency) and data availability. This ensures that workflows are triggered at the right time and with the necessary data inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Oozie provides robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. If a workflow fails, Oozie can retry the failed actions or execute alternative actions based on predefined conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Oozie is highly extensible, allowing users to define custom actions and integrate with other systems. This makes it a versatile tool for managing diverse data processing tasks.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Oozie Workflow Scheduling</h3>
      <p><strong>Start Node:</strong> Marks the beginning of the workflow.</p>
      <p><strong>Action Nodes:</strong> Perform specific tasks such as running MapReduce jobs or Pig scripts.</p>
      <p><strong>Control Flow Nodes:</strong> Manage the execution path with decisions, forks, and joins.</p>

      <h2>Oozie Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Oozie is widely used in various real-life scenarios to manage and coordinate data pipelines and ETL processes. Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Pipeline Management:</strong> Oozie can orchestrate complex data pipelines that involve multiple steps and dependencies. For instance, a data pipeline might start with importing data using Sqoop, followed by data transformation using Hive, and finally storing the processed data in HDFS. Oozie ensures that each step is executed in the correct order and handles any errors that may occur.</li>
        <li><strong>ETL Processes:</strong> Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes often involve multiple stages of data processing. Oozie can manage these stages by scheduling and coordinating the execution of various Hadoop jobs. For example, an ETL workflow might extract data from a relational database, transform it using Pig scripts, and load the transformed data into HBase. Oozie ensures that each stage is completed successfully before moving on to the next.</li>
        <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Oozie is ideal for managing batch processing jobs that need to run at regular intervals. For example, a company might use Oozie to schedule daily data aggregation jobs that summarize sales data from the previous day. Oozie can trigger these jobs based on a predefined schedule and ensure that the results are available for reporting and analysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding ZooKeeper: A Coordination Service for Distributed Applications</h2>
      <p>Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service designed to manage configuration, synchronization, and naming for large-scale distributed systems. Originally developed at Yahoo!, ZooKeeper provides a centralized infrastructure that simplifies the complexity of coordinating distributed applications. It ensures that distributed processes can work together efficiently and reliably, even in the presence of failures.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="highlight-card">
      <h2>Coordination Service in Hadoop</h2>
      <p>ZooKeeper plays a crucial role in maintaining distributed consistency within the Hadoop ecosystem. Here’s how it helps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> ZooKeeper stores configuration information for distributed applications in a centralized location. This ensures that all nodes in the cluster have consistent and up-to-date configuration data, reducing the risk of configuration drift.</li>
        <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> ZooKeeper provides primitives for distributed synchronization, such as locks and barriers. These primitives help coordinate the execution of tasks across multiple nodes, ensuring that tasks are performed in the correct order and without conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Leader Election:</strong> In distributed systems, it’s often necessary to elect a leader to coordinate tasks. ZooKeeper simplifies this process by providing built-in support for leader election, ensuring that a single node is designated as the leader at any given time.</li>
        <li><strong>Naming Service:</strong> ZooKeeper acts as a naming registry, allowing distributed applications to look up and discover services dynamically. This is particularly useful in environments where services may be added or removed frequently.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>ZooKeeper Use Cases</h2>
      <p>ZooKeeper is widely used in various real-life scenarios to enhance the reliability and efficiency of distributed systems. Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Distributed Data Processing:</strong> In Hadoop, ZooKeeper is used to manage the coordination of tasks across the cluster. For example, it helps in managing the state of HBase, ensuring that region servers are properly coordinated and that data is consistently replicated.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure Recovery:</strong> ZooKeeper’s ability to maintain consistent state information and perform leader election makes it invaluable for failure recovery. If a node in the cluster fails, ZooKeeper can quickly reassign tasks to other nodes, ensuring minimal disruption to the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Discovery:</strong> In microservices architectures, ZooKeeper is used for service discovery, allowing services to register themselves and discover other services dynamically. This helps in building scalable and resilient systems where services can be added or removed without manual intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Distributed Locking:</strong> ZooKeeper’s distributed locking mechanism is used to prevent race conditions and ensure that critical sections of code are executed by only one node at a time. This is essential for maintaining data integrity in distributed applications.</li>
