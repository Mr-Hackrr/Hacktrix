      <h2>Overview of Hadoop</h2>
      <p>Hadoop is an open-source framework designed to store and process vast amounts of data efficiently and reliably. It uses a distributed storage and processing model to handle large-scale data workloads on commodity hardware, offering a cost-effective solution for data-heavy industries.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section" id="history">
      <h2>History and Evolution of Hadoop</h2>
      <p><strong>Early Beginnings:</strong> Hadoop’s roots trace back to the early 2000s when Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella were working on the Nutch search engine project. They needed a way to index the web more efficiently, which led to the development of a distributed computing framework inspired by Google’s MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Milestones:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>2005: Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella created Hadoop to support Nutch.</li>
        <li>2006: Yahoo! adopted Hadoop for its search engine, significantly contributing to its development.</li>
        <li>2008: Hadoop became a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation, gaining wider recognition and adoption.</li>
        <li>2011: The release of Hadoop 1.0 marked its maturity, with stable APIs and robust performance.</li>
        <li>2013: Hadoop 2.0 introduced YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which improved resource management and scalability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Features of Hadoop</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Scalability</h3>
          <p>Hadoop can scale from a single server to thousands of nodes, distributing computation and storage across the cluster, accommodating growth effortlessly.</p>
          <div class="highlight-card">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Facebook uses Hadoop to store and analyze petabytes of user data, enabling them to deliver personalized content and advertisements.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3>Fault Tolerance</h3>
          <p>Data is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring data availability and reliability even during unexpected hardware failures.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Hadoop for Big Data?</h2>
        <p>Hadoop offers numerous advantages that make it a preferred choice for big data analytics. Here are the key benefits of using Hadoop, presented with icons to keep the section visually engaging and SEO-friendly.</p>
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-4 highlight-card">
            <h3>✅ Scalability 📈</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hadoop is designed to scale horizontally, meaning you can add more nodes to the cluster to handle increasing amounts of data. This scalability ensures that Hadoop can grow with your data needs without requiring significant changes to the existing infrastructure.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Horizontal Scaling: Easily add more nodes to the cluster.</li>
              <li>No Downtime: Scale without interrupting ongoing processes.</li>
              <li>Future-Proof: Accommodates growing data volumes seamlessly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Social media platforms like Twitter use Hadoop to manage and analyze the massive amounts of data generated by users daily. As data volumes grow, they can simply add more nodes to their Hadoop cluster to maintain performance and efficiency.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-md-4 highlight-card">
            <h3>✅ Cost-Effectiveness 💰</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hadoop is an open-source framework, which means it is free to use. Additionally, it runs on commodity hardware, which is much cheaper than specialized, high-end servers. This makes Hadoop a cost-effective solution for storing and processing large volumes of data.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open-Source: No licensing fees.</li>
              <li>Commodity Hardware: Uses affordable, off-the-shelf hardware.</li>
              <li>Lower Total Cost of Ownership: Reduces overall infrastructure costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Retail giants like Walmart use Hadoop to analyze sales data from numerous stores. By leveraging cost-effective hardware and open-source software, they can manage and process vast amounts of data without incurring prohibitive costs.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-md-4 highlight-card">
            <h3>✅ Fault Tolerance 🔄</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hadoop ensures data reliability and availability through its fault-tolerant design. Data is automatically replicated across multiple nodes, so if one node fails, the data can still be accessed from another node. This replication mechanism ensures that data is not lost and remains accessible even in the event of hardware failures.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Data Replication: Automatically replicates data across multiple nodes.</li>
              <li>High Availability: Ensures data is always accessible.</li>
              <li>Robust Recovery: Quickly recovers from node failures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> In the financial sector, where data integrity is crucial, Hadoop’s fault tolerance ensures that transaction data is not lost even if some servers fail, maintaining continuous service and data accuracy.</p>

            <h3>⚠️ Complexity 🛠️</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hadoop has a steep learning curve, especially for developers who are new to distributed computing. The complexity arises from its ecosystem, which includes various components like HDFS, YARN, and MapReduce, each requiring a deep understanding to use effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Steep Learning Curve: Requires significant time and effort to master.</li>
              <li>Complex Ecosystem: Multiple components and tools to learn and integrate.</li>
              <li>Specialized Skills: Developers need to be proficient in Java, MapReduce, and other Hadoop-related technologies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> New developers at a tech company may find it challenging to quickly become productive with Hadoop due to its complexity and the need for specialized training.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-md-4 highlight-card" style="background-color: #fff3cd;">
            <h3>⚠️ Latency ⏳</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hadoop is not ideal for real-time processing due to its batch processing nature. The MapReduce model, while powerful for large-scale data processing, introduces latency that makes it unsuitable for applications requiring real-time or near-real-time data processing.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Batch Processing: Processes data in large batches, leading to delays.</li>
              <li>High Latency: Not suitable for real-time analytics or streaming data.</li>
              <li>Alternative Solutions: Real-time processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Apache Flink may be needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A financial trading platform requiring real-time data analysis and decision-making might find Hadoop’s latency unacceptable and may opt for faster, real-time processing solutions.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-md-4 highlight-card" style="background-color: #fff3cd;">
            <h3>⚠️ Small Files Issue 📂</h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hadoop is inefficient when dealing with a large number of small files. HDFS is optimized for storing and processing large files, and handling many small files can lead to performance degradation and increased overhead.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Inefficiency: Poor performance with numerous small files.</li>
              <li>Increased Overhead: Managing metadata for many small files can strain the NameNode.</li>
              <li>Workarounds Needed: Techniques like file consolidation or using HBase for small data sets.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A media company storing millions of small image files may experience performance issues with Hadoop and might need to implement strategies to consolidate files or use alternative storage solutions.</p>
